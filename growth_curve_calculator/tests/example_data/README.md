# Example data

The example data in this folder consists of three XML files output by a SpectraMax iD3 plate reader:
* `Public_New ABS Protocol8_6_2024 10_22_52 PM_8_6_2024 10_20_55 PM.xml`
* `Public_New ABS Protocol8_19_2024 7_07_41 PM_8_19_2024 7_06_44 PM.xml`
* `Public_New ABS Protocol9_6_2024 10_54_51 PM_9_6_2024 10_53_28 PM.xml`

These XML files were arbitrarily chosen from a large set of optical density measurements collected at Arcadia on a variety of protist and algal species including Phaeodactylum, Protococcus, Tetraselmis, Chlamydomonas, Isochrysis, and Dunaliella. Samples from cultures of these organisms were placed into wells of a 96-well plate and scanned by the SpectraMax iD3 plate reader daily to measure their optical density, as a proxy for their growth.
